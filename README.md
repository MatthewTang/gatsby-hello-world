  Gatsby's hello-world starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this hello-world boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the hello-world starter
    gatsby new my-hello-world-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-hello-world-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-hello-world-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🚀 Quick start (Gatsby Cloud)

Deploy this starter with one click on [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/):

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── static
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`/static`**: This directory contains assets that will be copied directly into the `public` folder during the build.

4.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

5.  **`.prettierignore`**: This file tells Prettier which files to ignore when formatting.

6.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

7.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

8.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

9.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

10. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

11. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

This starter doesn’t include `gatsby-browser.js`, `gatsby-node.js`, or `gatsby-ssr.js` by default. You can add these files to customize Gatsby’s browser, build, or server-side rendering APIs as needed.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

## 💫 Deploy

[Build, Deploy, and Host On The Only Cloud Built For Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/)

Gatsby Cloud is an end-to-end cloud platform specifically built for the Gatsby framework that combines a modern developer experience with an optimized, global edge network.

## 🔧 Build Environment Consistency

This project includes version pinning to ensure consistent builds across different environments, especially for Vercel deployments:

- **Node.js Version**: Pinned to 18.x via `engines` field in `package.json` and `.nvmrc` file
- **npm Version**: Pinned to 9.x via `engines` field and `packageManager` field in `package.json`
- **Reproducible Builds**: Use `npm ci` for exact dependency installation from `package-lock.json`

### For Local Development

```bash
# Use the pinned Node version (if using nvm)
nvm use

# Install dependencies exactly as specified in lock file
npm ci

# Build the project
npm run build
```

This setup prevents build failures caused by lock file inconsistencies between local development and CI/CD environments.
